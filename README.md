## Build it yourself (on a mac)

You will need to follow the guidelines to build ionic capacitor apps at https://capacitorjs.com/docs.

At a minimum, run the following commands to run the app in a browser

```
git clone https://github.com/bmlt-enabled/BMLTSearch3.git
cd BMLTSearch3
npm install -g @ionic/cli
npm install
ionic build
ionic serve
```

The `ionic serve` command should load the web version of the app to a browser on your laptop, which will be visible on http://localhost:8100/home

To build the smartphone apps, you will need to have Xcode installed (for ios apps) and Android Studio installed (for android apps)

To open the ios project in Xcode, run
```
ionic cap build ios
```

To open the android project in Android Studio, run 
```
ionic cap build android
```

## Branches
